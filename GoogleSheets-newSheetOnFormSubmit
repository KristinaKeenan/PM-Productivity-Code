//Create Sheet on Form Submission
//This code generates a new sheet automatically on a form submission, and can fill in form details as needed.
//Steps:
//1) Create a Google Form and connect to a Google Sheet (or vice versa)
//2) Go to Tools->Script Editor
//3) Paste this code and personalize
//4) Save sheet
//5) Under Triggers, set "onFormSubmit" to run, and event type to "on form fubmit"
//6) Test with a new form submission!


//Runs createSheet every time there is a new form submission
function onFormSubmit(e){
  var formValues = e.values;
  createSheet(formValues);
}

//Creates a new sheet/tab 
function createSheet(formValues){
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var inSheet = false;

  //Replace 1 with the form response you'd like to name the new sheet after
  inSheet = isInSheet(ss, formValues[1], inSheet);

  //If there is a sheet already named after the chosen form response, a new tab is created with that respone followed by the word "copy"
  if(inSheet){
    //Replace 1 with the form response you'd like to name the new sheet after
    var create = ss.insertSheet(formValues[1]+" copy");//create a new sheet with the value
    fillSheet(create, formValues);
  }
  //If there isn't a sheet already named after the form response, proceed with creating the new sheet
  else{
    //Replace 1 with the form response you'd like to name the new sheet after
    var create = ss.insertSheet(formValues[1]);
    fillSheet(create, formValues);
  } 


}

//Determines if there is already a sheet named after the value taken from the form response; returns true or false
function isInSheet(ss, tabName, inSheet) {
  for(var j=0; j<ss.getNumSheets(); j++){

        if(ss.getSheets()[j].getName()==tabName){
          inSheet = true;
          break;
        }
      }
  return inSheet;
}

//Fill new sheet with information from form responses
function fillSheet(create, formValues){
  create.getRange(1,1).setValue("INSERT CAPTION 1");
  create.getRange(1,2).setValue(formValues[1]);
  //create.getRange(2,1).setValue("INSERT CAPTION 2");
  //create.getRange(2,2).setValue(formValues[2]);
  //etc.
}
